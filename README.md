# PaymentCardProject

##Code Status:  WORKING

##Python Version: 3.4.3

##Summary:  
This project is aimed at creating a tool to generate legitimate credit card numbers based on partial user input.  This tool will be used as a training aid to demonstrate to users the quickness with which only *legitimate* credit card numbers can be generated then combined with OSINT to compromise their personally identifiable/financial information. The training should give the users a reality check and influence a change in behavior toward safer behavior. This tool is not intended for malicious use.

"""
NOTES: 
The payment_cards.py file is a class file that needs to be placed in a directory called cards and you need a blank _ _init_ _.py (without the spaces) file in the directory with it.  If you do not do this then the actual program credit_card_builder.py will not work
