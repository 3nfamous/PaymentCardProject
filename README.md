# PaymentCardProject
#Code Status:  IN PROGRESS
#Summary:  This project is aimed at creating a tool to generate legitimate credit card numbers based on partial user input.

"""
NOTES: 
The payment_cards.py file is a class file that needs to be placed in a directory called cards and you need a blank __init__.py file in the directory with it.  If you do not do this then the actual program credit_card_builder.py will not work
